Task of "Expressions & Integers"\
Write a program resistance.cpp that computes the equivalent resistance of the following wiring:\
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e77ed07-a366-4bb1-aa84-515fcbebe388) \
We assume that R1, R2, R3 have an integer valued resistance. After input of the four values, the program should output the result arithmetically rounded to the nearest integer.
Remark: In order to facilitate the task, you may want to:
- conceptually divide the task into sub tasks. For example, start with computation of serial resistors R12 and R34
- solve the task first naively using default rounding and then think about how to accomplish arithmetic rounding.\
You can find formulas for computing the total resistance in this Wikipedia article.
Important: using floating point numbers is forbidden.

Task of "Boolean expressions & Basic loops"\
Fibonacci Primes:\
Fibonacci numbers are the integers in the following sequence: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,... Each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. Fibonacci primes are Fibonacci numbers that are also prime numbers. Write a program that asks the user for an integer m and then computes and prints all Fibonacci primes between 0 and m (including). Print each number on a new line. Finally, on a new line print the total number of Fibonacci primes found.

Example: If your program is asked to print the Fibonacci primes between 0 and 14the output should look something like this:\
2\
3\
5\
13\
Found 4 Fibonacci primes
