Task of "Expressions & Integers"\
Write a program resistance.cpp that computes the equivalent resistance of the following wiring:\

We assume that R1, R2, R3 have an integer valued resistance. After input of the four values, the program should output the result arithmetically rounded to the nearest integer.
Remark: In order to facilitate the task, you may want to:
- conceptually divide the task into sub tasks. For example, start with computation of serial resistors R12 and R34
- solve the task first naively using default rounding and then think about how to accomplish arithmetic rounding.\
You can find formulas for computing the total resistance in this Wikipedia article.
Important: using floating point numbers is forbidden.
